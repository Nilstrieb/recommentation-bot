# recommendation-bot

A small discord bot.

Use the 'recommend' (alias: reco, r) command to say that you liked something (a show for example).
Use the 'subscribe' (alias: sub, s) command to subscribe to other users, making their recommendations
have a bigger weight.

Recommendations are stored using Neo4J, a Graph Database
